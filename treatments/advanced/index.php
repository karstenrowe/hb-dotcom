	      	<h2 id="dermal-fillers" class="treatment-product-section-label">Dermal Fillers</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>We offer a number of different dermal fillers; <a href="http://www.restylane.co.uk/" target="_blank">Restylane®/Perlane, </a><a href="http://www.juvederm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Juvederm®, </a><a href="http://www.radiesse.com/" target="_blank">Radiesse®.</a></p>
						<p>All treatments have been subject to stringent testing by their manufacturers and established in the market place with proven results.</p>
						<p>These consist of hyaluronic acid which is a natural occurring substance in our skin to help hydrate and add volume. It instantly smooths away facial wrinkles and folds and restores skin volume; it is also used to redefine lips for a natural look. The product (hyaluronic acid) is unique because it contains lidocaine (built in anaesthetic) which makes the injection process more comfortable. No skin test is required and results are instant with minimal down time.</p>
						<p>Results usually last in excess of 6 months and in some cases more than 1 year. To retain results, we would recommend maintenance treatments.</p>
					</div>

	      	<h2 id="dermaroller" class="treatment-product-section-label">Dermaroller and eDermastamp</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Provides advanced skin micro-surgical needling, a procedure that stimulates the skin to regenerate and repair itself naturally and safely, creating smoother, healthier, younger looking skin.</p>
						<p>It can significantly improve the appearance of acne scars, aged and sun damaged skin, facial and décolleté lines, wrinkles and stretch marks and particularly small areas such as lip lines and crepey skin using skin rejuvenating mesotherapy solutions.</p>
					</div>

	      	<h2 id="face-lifts" class="treatment-product-section-label">Face & Y lifts</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Non Surgical lifts can restore volume loss and sculpt the face and cheeks as well as hydrate the skin.</p>
						<p>When we age, the face loses volume causing us to perceive our face as sagging or drooping. When the skin’s elasticity declines dramatically, the effects of gravity become all too evident.</p>
						<p>Non-surgical procedures improve facial appearance by restoring the three dimensional contour of the face without the need for surgery.</p>
						<p>The lifting effect is instantly rejuvenating and natural in appearance, also known as the Y lift. Using dermal fillers such as <a href="http://www.restylane.co.uk/What-is-Restylane/products/fillers/SubQ/" target="_blank">Restylane® Sub Q</a> and <a href="http://www.juvederm.co.uk/dermal-fillers/cheek-fillers.aspx" target="_blank">Juvederm® Voluma</a> to contour cheeks and midface.</p>
						<p>This technique works best in the 40-65 year old age group.</p>

					<h2 id="hands-chest" class="treatment-product-section-label">Hands and Chest</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Very often people usually concentrate on their faces in terms of cosmetic treatments. However, it is often the texture of skin on the hands and/or the décolletage (chest) that give away someone’s age or can make them appear older than they are.</p>
						<p>In the last couple of years there has been an upsurge in popularity of treatments to the hands and chest as people have become increasingly aware of these.</p>
						<p>When it comes to sun protection, hands and the décolletage often get forgotten or at least, are not protected sufficiently. As a result these two areas in particular can prematurely age as well as the facial skin. Treatment options include as short course of Restylane® Vital which plumps, smooths and hydrates crepey aged skin.</p>
						<p>Restylane® Vital and medical needling can be combined for a more intensive treatment.</p>
						<p>Radiesse® injectible dermal filler for long lasting volume on the back of hands, making veins and tendons less visible. It is a safe gel formula with calcium micropheres which stimulate the production of new collagen. Discomfort level is minimal.</p>

					<h2 id="hyperhydrosis" class="treatment-product-section-label">Hyperhydrosis</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>The same products can be used to treat excessive perspiration by injecting into the sweat glands in the arm pits.</p>
						<p>The procedure is quick, safe and has dramatic results.</p>

	      	<h2 id="ipl-hair-removal" class="treatment-product-section-label">IPL - Laser Hair Removal</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) Treatment for the removal of unwanted hair.</p>
						<p>The Luminette Advance IPL hair removal system treats a range of skin types and hair colours simply and effectively. It offers a highly successful long term solution to hair removal. The procedure involves treating the hair with a light source of specific wavelength and strength to destroy the hair root and hence prevent further hair growth in that area.</p>
						<p>Extensive areas can be treated in one treatment session, although with any such system, a number of treatments may be required to achieve the optimum result. This is all discussed during the initial consultation. A patch test is also performed at the time of the first consultation to determine the skin response and to help ensure highly effective results in the subsequent treatments.</p>
	      	</div>

					<h2 id="ipl-photo" class="treatment-product-section-label">IPL - Photo Rejuvenation</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Luminette Advance IPL (intense pulsed light) is a non-invasive treatment breakthrough that erases skin damage without disruption of the skin’s surface, hence no downtime.</p>
						<p>It can simultaneously treat a wide range of facial imperfections safely and effectively such as broken capillaries, skin discolouration, age spots, freckles, sun damage, mottled pigmentation and rosacea. It also improves enlarged pores and dull complexions to give a smoother, revitalised skin. The skin feels tighter and looks firmer. The same treatment can be used highly effectively on the neck, chest and hands.</p>
						<p>A cold gel is applied to the area to be treated and pulses of light are applied. Usually a course of treatment is recommended and the number of treatments required would be discussed at the time of the initial consultation, as it varies from patient to patient. This provides excellent long-term results and minimal adverse effects. It offers a safe, dramatically rejuvenating treatment that can be tailored to your own individual skin condition and skin type, providing superior cosmetic results and outstanding satisfaction.</p>
						<p>Each treatment takes about 20 minutes and you can return to work the same day and resume all your regular activities.</p>

						<p>Small purple or red veins can also form anywhere on the leg, from the top of the thigh to the ankle. While these thread veins do not pose any major health problems, they may cause discomfort. Many people who have thread veins find them unsightly and embarrassing, and often attempt to conceal them with clothing or resort to cosmetic cover-ups, the results of which are often disappointing. Today a simple treatment called Microsclerotherapy is successfully being used to correct unwanted thread veins of the legs.</p>

						<p>Women aged between 50-70 years of age generally lose 20% of their head hair. In men, receding hair line is often genetically pre-programmed, even at a young age. Stress or a deficiency in vital nutrients can also play a role.</p>

	      	<h2 id="microsclerotherapy" class="treatment-product-section-label">Microsclerotherapy</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Microsclerotherapy is the gold standard procedure used for the removal of surface thread veins, known as telangiectases, on legs.</p>
						<p>The treatment is undertaken by experienced clinical nurse specialists with considerable knowledge of the technique. The legs should not be shaved or have moisturiser on them to prevent any complications of treatment.</p>
						<p>A sclerosing agent is injected directly into the veins using a very fine needle. The solution irritates the lining of the vein causing the walls of the vein to stick together. Blood stops flowing through the veins which are then absorbed by the body’s natural defence mechanism.</p>
						<p>The procedure takes ½ hour and you will be required to wear class 2 compression stockings for 3 days which you can buy at the clinic. You can carry on with normal activity although nothing aerobic for 24 hours. These stockings should be worn on long haul flights following sclerotherapy.</p>
						<p>Some bruising may appear and can last from 2 weeks and in some cases longer. The legs may appear a little worse because of bruising so it is necessary to be patient.</p>
						<p>Microsclerotherapy is a very successful treatment for surface veins and a good outcome is generally expected. Realistic expectations avoid disappointment so continuous discussion with the specialist is essential.</p>
					</div>

	      	<h2 id="muscle-relaxing" class="treatment-product-section-label">Muscle Relaxing Treatments</h2>
					<div class="thumb-list-item">
						<p>Ideal areas for treatment are wrinkles caused by muscles that have no significant function such as the deep creases between the eyebrows, crow’s feet and forehead lines.</p>
						<p>Good results can be obtained after a single injection and the effect generally lasts between 3-4 months. The procedure is simple to perform and it is important to note that it takes 7-14 days for the treatment to work.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Botox</li>
							<li>Vistabel</li>
							<li>Azzalure</li>

						<p>The Skin Peel, depending on skin type, is a treatment designed to improve and enhance the skin by chemically exfoliating the skin.

						<p>The treatment involves a simple 20 minute procedure which painlessly removes the micro-thin top layer of the skin. It is this top layer which is a significant obstruction to having better skin because it clogs the pores. Treated skin appears smoother and softer giving a plumper and more hydrated feel. Skin peels can be used as part of your skin health programme prescription.</p>
						<p>A course of 4-6 treatment is necessary but improvement is seen after 1 session.</p>
						<p>There may be a light flaking of dry skin following a treatment. There is little or no down time with epidermal peels, allowing patients to go about their daily routine.</p>

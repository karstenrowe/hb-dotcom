		    	<h2 class="pull-out">About Harrogate Health & Beauty Cosmetic Clinic<span>A short introduction.</span></h2>
					<p class="lead">Qualified as a Registered General Nurse in Denmark, Bente became a Nursing Sister in Accident & Emergency at Harrogate District Hospital and is registered with the <a href="http://www.nmc-uk.org/" target="_blank">Nursing Midwifery Council UK</a> and <a href="http://www.cosmeticnurses.org/" target="_blank">British Association of Cosmetic Nurses</a> (BACN).</p>
					<p>She achieved <a href="http://itecworld.co.uk/" target="_blank">ITEC Honours</a> and <a href="http://www.cidesco.com/" target="_blank">CIDESCO</a> at the Yorkshire College of Beauty Therapy, being awarded Student of the year. Followed by further advanced qualifications before establishing Harrogate Health & Beauty Cosmetic Clinic in 1990.</p>
					<blockquote>Bente prides herself on her ongoing professional development, regularly attending key conferences and training in many new treatments and products.</blockquote>
					<p>She is now recognised as a leading facialist and cosmetic nurse who can offer skin treatments for wrinkle reduction and skin revitalisation.</p>
					<p>Cosmetic treatments bridge the gap between beauty and surgery. Specialists within this field use minimally invasive techniques to produce dramatic results. The science of ageing can be delayed and reversed with minimal discomfort and time out from your lives.</p>
					<p>The consultation is the most important part of a patientâ€™s journey and should never be under-estimated.</p>
					<blockquote>For all new patients, we always commence with a consultation, we will carry out a thorough skin assessment and discuss individual needs on a one to one basis in a relaxed but informal atmosphere.</blockquote>
					<p>All treatments are individually planned and tailor made to your unique requirements. During consultations we explain all the options and recommend the most suitable treatment or combination of treatments for you.</p>
					<p>An appointment for a consultation can be booked by telephoning 01423 563 108.</p>
